                    <h3>About Jesse</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our story begins on a cloudy Wednesday in January. Young Joanne Carlberg was being rushed to
                        Methodist hospital after being pregnant for 37 weeks. The soon to be father of two, Eric was
                        just happy Joanne’s mother was available to watch their four year old son, Zachary, as they
                        rushed to the hospital. After parking sideways in a spot and running to the check-in desk they
                        were greeted by their doctor, who looked exactly like Robert Redford but had an Eastern Slavic
                        surname of Pushkin. A name that Eric routinely made quips about because he was a maternity ward
                        doctor.

                    <h3>Jesse's vital stats</h3>
                    <p>
                        Jesse has amassed much mass in his time. Peaking at a bench of 370 lbs (2x his bodyweight at the
                        time), he's a bundle of energy not to be underestimated. He's an quick-witted comical genious
                        that will surprise and delight you every day (author's note).

                        I used to enjoy rock climbing, and was an instructor for a while but after having three kids, I

                        credit because of the shame. The shame!

                    <h3>Jesse's History</h3>
                    <p>
                        I grew up in Omaha, Nebraska with my mother Joanne, my older brother Zach and my younger sister
                        Erica. My parents divorced when I was three and my father moved to Kansas City to work in the
                        hospitality industry. He would move several other places around the country over the years and
                        my siblings and I would visit him during summer breaks.
                        <br />
                        I attended Westside High School, graduating in 2012. During my senior year of high school I took
                        an EMT-B course at Methodist University and completed it shortly after graduating. I then took a
                        job as an EMT at Rural/Metro Ambulance, where my brother was also employed. While working there
                        I attended Paramedic school at Methodist and completed my clinical requirements on the job.
                        After two years with the ambulance company I went part time and took a full time position at
                        UNMC as Certified Cardiac Tech, where I would interpret EKC rhythms and report on them medical
                        staff.

                        Raise three independent children. My older two have autism, so this is an ever changing goal
                        that usually equates to, raise three happy children.
                        <br />
                        I am a Buddhist so reaching enlightenment is always a goal but maybe just mindfulness and being
                        present is good enough.

                    Jackson is 10 and my oldest child. Everly is 7 and a handful. Maverick, the youngest at 4 has no
                    super powers of autism and is a neurotypical child that likes to wrestle and use his punchers on
                    bad guys. Sarah, my wife, is a nurse and is the opposite of me in every
                    way, which balances out the children.
